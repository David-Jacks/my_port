            <p>I am a Software Developer, and a Community Individual</p>
            <p>I Completed High School with a degree in Elective Science</p>
            <p>I am a currently at Lancaster University Ghana</p>
            <p>And I am studying Computer Science</p>
            <p> I was born in the month of anonymous</p>
            <p> I realized early, that i am a person who believes in being great one day</p>
            <p> So I started to plan for my life</p>
            <p> And During the process of planing i found my vision in life</p>
            <p>My vision was all concerned about God and computer science</p>
            <p>Computer Science is very broad, so I decided to start from software development</p>
            <p>And later pursue machine learning and Artificial intelligence</p>
            <p> I am currently in my first year and i am looking out for an internship in any FAANG company</p>
            <p>I realized due to research conducted on these companies that, i need Data Structures and Algorithms</p>
            <p> So from then leetcode became my friend!</p>
            <p> Hence this is the little to know about me for now! </p>
